# CUDA_IsingSpinDynamics
This repository contains my personal project for the "Modern Computing for Physics" master course in Physics of Data. It features two implementations of a 2D spin Ising model simulation: one running on the CPU and the other optimized for Nvidia GPUs. The GPU version has been specifically developed and tested on a Jetson Nano Developer Kit (2GB).
